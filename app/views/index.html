      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this page</h2>

      <!-- TODO: don't hardcode richardTowers here - ideally set an environment variable and use that -->
      <p>We recommend you add links to your prototype to this page, rather than delete it.
      You can edit this page in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/richardTowers/govuk_prototype_kit/edit/master/app/views/index.html">/app/views/index.html</a>.</p>

      <p>You can change the service name by editing the file <a href="https://github.com/richardTowers/govuk_prototype_kit/edit/master/app/config.js">/app/config.js</a>.</p>

      <p>Once you've made your edits you can re-deploy your prototype to GOV.UK PaaS by pressing the button in
      <a href="https://github.com/richardTowers/govuk_prototype_kit/#readme">your README</a>.
